# Hello👋, I'm Fanceir.

- <p className="inline-flex gap-1">👨‍💻 Avatar: Fireflies <img src="/img/logo.webp" width="26" heigth="26" className="rounded-full" /></p>

- 🧑 A junior student currently studying frontend development, hoping to land an internship by the end of this year.

- 🎈 I have tried participating in some ACM competitions, but with no great results, a total loser.

- 🤯 I enjoy discovering new things, feel free to reach out to me!

- 🎮 A legendary FPS gamer with plenty of experience being taken down in seconds – not very skilled, but totally addicted.

- 💡 I usually summarize my learning process in the form of projects or blog posts and enjoy sharing them with others. I believe it’s valuable for others to reference my work while learning new technologies.


### My Programming Journey

I got into computers relatively late, only getting my first laptop after my college entrance exams. During that summer break, I was still absorbed in gaming. It wasn’t until I started university that I truly got into programming.

In my first year, I learned C language, but without clear direction, I didn't learn it very well. During my second year, I started studying frontend development and learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue, among other technologies. As I dove deeper, I found my passion — I love frontend development, love coding, and enjoy turning my ideas into reality.

I'm still continuing to explore frontend knowledge, hoping to secure an internship in the field.

### Hobbies & Interests

- **FPS** Played many FPS games, including CSGO, Valorant, etc. But I’m not very good at them, I just enjoy playing.

- **Programming & Development** I love bringing ideas to life and enjoy the process of creating.
